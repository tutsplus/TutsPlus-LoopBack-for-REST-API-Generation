# [Generate REST APIs With LoopBack][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


Writing a RESTful API for Node and Express is time consuming. You have to design and code each model, with security, parameters, REST endpoints, and even the HTTP status codes. LoopBack, however, takes the pain out of creating an API, and can dramatically reduce your development time.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will show you how to get started using LoopBack to speed up back-end development. You'll follow along as Jeremy creates a simple REST API for application data. Along the way, you'll see how to create relational connections between models, how to secure the API with access control, and how to define endpoints with custom application logic.
